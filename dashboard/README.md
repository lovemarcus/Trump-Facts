# Dashboard

I recommend always working with one file. That is, everyone should import the file [```dashboards.json```](dashboards.json) to Kibana. Then, if you add any new features export it and upload it again! Just make sure that everyone knows that you are currently working on it in order to avoid anyone overwriting your work! Thus, for precaution, you might upload the updated file as ```dashboards_feature1.json```
