#### Current State of the project

So far we are preparing the
- [X] Tweets parsed and posted to **ElasticSearch**
- [X] Sentiment Analysis of tweets
- [ ] Visualization of the tweets using **Kibana**
	- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis**
		* Filter tweets in two categories: Positive (>0.5) and Negative (<-0.5) and obtain the two corresponding wordclouds.
		* Remove stop words. 
		* Graphical representation of the percentile of positive tweets retrieved for a given word.
	- [Â ] **Locations/People Heatmap/Wordcloud**
		* Use [NER](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml) or a similar tool to extract places/organizations/people mentioned by Trump's tweets. Plot a corresponding Wordcloud.
		* Obtain geo-localization of the places/organizations and plot them in a Heatmap.
	- [ ] **Hourly Tweet Histogram**
		* Find a way to plot just depending on the hour of the day.
		* Plot corresponding histogram.
- [ ] **Report** using Overleaf, find link [here](https://www.overleaf.com/9353622vmdbczthhksc#/33786110/)
	* Introduction and abstract sections has been started. Feel free to modify them.

Visualization of Trump Tweets using Kibana and ElasticSearch.

This project is currently being developed as part of the [DD2476 Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems course](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2476?l=en) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://kth.se), spring 2017.

## Data

The tweets from Trump were downloaded from [this repo](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive) by [bpb27](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive).

### Data format

The tweet data is stored in JSON files, which have been formed accessing the Twitter API. Detailed information of the fields within the JSON files can be found [here](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets).

### Data Parsing

Not all the data provided by the Twitter API is relevant to us. Furthermore, we might want to extend it and add new fields. Thus, we provide a script to process the original data. For more detailed information look into [parsing](parsing) folder 

## Install Dependencies
Simply run the bash script

```
./install_dependencies
```
