## Data

The tweets from Trump were downloaded from [this repo](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive) by [bpb27](https://github.com/bpb27/trump_tweet_data_archive).

### Data format

The tweet data is stored in JSON files, which have been formed accessing the Twitter API. Detailed information of the fields within the JSON files can be found [here](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets).

### Data Parsing

Not all the data provided by the Twitter API is relevant to us. Furthermore, we might want to extend it and add new fields. Thus, we provide a script to process the original data. For more detailed information look into [parsing](parsing) folder
